# Data cleanup

This won't take much. The data is pretty simple. Just going to import it, filter out Nebraska and export it to the working data folder.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
loans <- read_csv("foia_150k_plus.csv")
```
```{r}
loans %>% filter(State == "NE") %>% group_by(City) %>% tally()
```



```{r}
loans %>% filter(State == "NE") %>% mutate(City = gsub("/NE", "", City)) %>% mutate(City = gsub("LINCOLN,", "LINCOLN", City)) %>% mutate(City = gsub("MCCOOK,", "MC COOK", City)) %>% write_csv("../data/neppp.csv")
```
